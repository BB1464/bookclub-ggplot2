You do this using the stat argument and by specifying a new variable for the y-axis. For instance, we might be interested in knowing the total price of all vehicles in the data set for each manufacturer. It may be interesting to see if four Land Rovers are more expensive than 14 Hyundais. (No disrepect to Hyundai drivers… I am one myself!) Unfortunately, price isn’t a variable in this dataset so, let’s use displ instead. The sum of displ isn’t particularly meaningful in real life, but it illustrates the use of the stat argument. This graph below uses displ for y in the aesthetic and uses the stat of identity so that it sums the total displacement for each manufacturer. ggplot(mpg, aes(manufacturer, displ)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) This plot now shows the total displacement. mpg %&gt;% group_by(manufacturer) %&gt;% summarize(sum(displ)) ## # A tibble: 15 × 2 ## manufacturer `sum(displ)` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 audi 45.8 ## 2 chevrolet 96.2 ## 3 dodge 162 ## 4 ford 113. ## 5 honda 15.4 ## 6 hyundai 34 ## 7 jeep 36.6 ## 8 land rover 17.2 ## 9 lincoln 16.2 ## 10 mercury 17.6 ## 11 nissan 42.5 ## 12 pontiac 19.8 ## 13 subaru 34.4 ## 14 toyota 100. ## 15 volkswagen 60.9 geom_line and geom_path which generates a line chart or path chart (useful for time series data) check help to see geom_line’s arguments like lineend and arrow ggplot(economics, aes(date, unemploy / pop)) + geom_line() ggplot(economics, aes(date, uempmed)) + geom_line() To investigate these plots further, we can draw them on the same plot. year &lt;- function(x) as.POSIXlt(x)$year + 1900 ggplot(economics, aes(unemploy / pop, uempmed)) + geom_path(color = &quot;grey50&quot;) + geom_point(aes(color = year(date))) "],["modifying-the-axes.html", "2.9 Modifying the Axes", " 2.9 Modifying the Axes xlab() and ylab() modify the axis labels ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point(alpha = 1/3) ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point(alpha = 1/3) + xlab(&quot;city driving (mpg)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;highway driving (mpg)&quot;) # remove labels with NULL ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point(alpha = 1/3) + xlab(NULL) + ylab(NULL) xlim() and ylim() modify the limits of the axes (boundaries) ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.25) ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.25) + xlim(&quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) + ylim(20, 30) ## Warning: Removed 137 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

In other words, you want to be able to distinguish individual subjects but not identify them. sometimes you want the individual geom to be a group of observations for the same individual. you do this by adding a group argument to the aesthetic. If you’re trying to figure out which variable to use as the grouping variable, fill in the blank “I have multiple observations for each _____”. Or for longitudinal studies, “I want to plot one line over time for each _____”. What’s the grouping variable for Oxboys? In the case of Oxboys, we want to plot a line over time for each boy, so Subject is the grouping variable in the aesthetic. ggplot(Oxboys, aes(age, height, group = Subject)) + geom_point() + geom_line() incorrectly specifying the grouping variable leads to a “characteristic sawtooth appearance”. ggplot(Oxboys, aes(age, height)) + geom_point() + geom_line() 4.4.2 Different Groups on Different Layers From the book: Sometimes we want to plot summaries that use different levels of aggregation: one layer might display individuals, while another displays an overall summary. now that we have plotted individual geoms, let’s add a collective geom which is the trendline for all boys together. ggplot(Oxboys, aes(age, height, group = Subject)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; #&gt; `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; something doesn’t look right expecting a collective geom (one summary line for all subjects), but we got individual geoms again – a trendline for each individual instead of a trendline for all individuals. “grouping controls both the display of the geoms, and the operation of the stats: one statistical transformation is run for each group”. we got multiple geom_smooths because we had the grouping variable in the ggplot line so the grouping flows down to all layers of the plot to get what we intend, we need to uncouple the grouping variable at the ggplot layer and add it where we want the grouping to happen, namely only at the geom_line layer. That allows the default grouping from the ggplot layer (i.e., no special grouping or just group on the whole dataset) to flow down to the geom_smooth layer. ggplot(Oxboys, aes(age, height)) + geom_line(aes(group = Subject)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, size = 2, se = FALSE) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; #&gt; `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 4.4.3 Overriding the Default Grouping In the last exercise, we finally got the grouping right. This hints at the approach of overriding the default grouping. By adding the grouping to geom_line, we overrode the default grouping, which was “no special grouping”. Here’s another example to help illustrate this point a little better. Thanks to this blog post. Subtitles are added to these plots to describe what’s going on. ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy)) + geom_jitter() + stat_boxplot(fill = NA) + labs(subtitle = &quot;stat_boxplot automatically uses the groups set by the categorical variable drv.\\nNotice that there is only one boxplot for each value of drv.&quot;) ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, hwy, color = factor(year))) + geom_jitter() + stat_boxplot(fill = NA) + labs(subtitle = &quot;by now adding color based on year, it creates a new group for the boxplots as well,\\nand there are now two for each categorical.

Never rely on the defaults. Always adjust your bin or xlim to “zoom” in our out of your data. There is no hard or fast rule, only experimentation to discover coorelation in your plot. For your audience/reader, ensure you add a caption for your scale, for example binwidth. Three ways to compare distribution: - Show small multiples of the histogram, facet_wrap(~ var). - Use colour and a frequency polygon, geom_freqpoly(). - Use a “conditional density plot”, geom_histogram(position = \"fill\"). ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth)) + geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 0.1, na.rm = TRUE) + xlim(58, 68) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill = cut), binwidth = 0.1, position = &quot;fill&quot;, na.rm = TRUE) + xlim(58, 68) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) You can also plot density using geom_density().

There is not direct hard or fast rule for scaling the binwidth. What is important is to find the appropriate size that best captures the representation (or distribution) of your analysis. This correlates to your story as you are explaining the importance. Find a binwidth that best captures your ideas. Draw a histogram of price. What interesting patterns do you see? ggplot(diamonds, aes(price)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) The smaller the quantity (assuming quality), the higher the price. I presume that carat size would also have a strong correlation with quantity and price. How does the distribution of price vary with clarity? ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, price)) + geom_violin() ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, price)) + geom_boxplot() I presume using different geoms, the higher the clarity, the higher the price, the fewer the quantity.

By default, 40% is used. You can overide the default with width and height arguments. Alternatively, we can think of overplotting as a 2d density estimation problem, which gives rise to two more approaches: Bin the points and count the number in each bin, then visualise that count (the 2d generalisation of the histogram), geom_bin2d(). The code below compares square and hexagonal bins, using parameters bins and binwidth to control the number and size of the bins. norm + geom_bin2d() norm + geom_bin2d(bins = 10) library(hexbin) norm + geom_hex() norm + geom_hex(bins = 10) Another approach to dealing with overplotting is to add data summaries to help guide the eye to the true shape of the pattern within the data.

But what if we want a summary other than count? So far, we’ve just used the default statistical transformation associated with each geom.

It may also be helpful to understand position scales and axes as position scales and guides, because axes they share the same API as guides for non-positional scales like color legends. The parallel will be clearer in the next chapter. It’s worthwhile to read documentations of the {scales} package to learn more about scales, since that handles a lot of the (re-)scaling and transformation under the hood. It may be good to start with the rstudio::conf2020 talk on scales. It should also be noted that there’s some discussion about revamping the scales_* API.

We’ll use a modern attempt called the HCL colour space, which has three components of hue, chroma and luminance: -Hue ranges from 0 to 360 (an angle) and gives the “colour” of the colour (blue, red, orange, etc). -Chroma is the “purity” of a colour, ranging from 0 (grey) to a maximum that varies with luminance. -Luminance is the lightness of the colour, ranging from 0 (black) to 1 (white). An additional complication is that many people (~10% of men) do not possess the normal complement of colour receptors and so can distinguish fewer colours than usual. In brief, it’s best to avoid red-green contrasts, and to check your plots with systems that simulate colour blindness. Visicheck (https://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/) is one online solution. Another alternative is the dichromat package34 which provides tools for simulating colour blindness, and a set of colour schemes known to work well for colour-blind people. You can also help people with colour blindness in the same way that you can help people with black-and-white printers: by providing redundant mappings to other aesthetics like size, line type or shape. 11.1.1 Colour blindness "],["continuous-colour-scales.html", "11.2 Continuous colour scales", " 11.2 Continuous colour scales Colour gradients are often used to show the height of a 2d surface. The plots in this section use the surface of a 2d density estimate of the faithful dataset which records the waiting time between eruptions and during each eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone Park. Any time I refer to scale_fill_() in this section there is a corresponding scale_colour_() for the colour aesthetic (or scale_color_*() if you prefer US spelling). 11.2.1 Particular pallettes There are multiple ways to specify continuous colour scales. You can use to construct your own palette, but it is unnecessary because there are many “hand picked” palettes available. Ggplot2 supplies two scale functions that bundle pre-specified palettes, scale_fill_viridis_c() and scale_fill_distiller(). The viridis scales are designed to be perceptually uniform in both colour and when reduced to black and white, and to be perceptible to people with various forms of colour blindness. The second group of continuous colour scales built in to ggplot2 are derived from the ColorBrewer scales: scale_fill_brewer() provides these colours as discrete palettes, while scale_fill_distiller() and scale_fill_fermenter() are the continuous and binned analogs. scale_fill_scico() provides palettes that are perceptually uniform and suitable for scientific visualisation A particularly useful package is paletteer which aims to provide a common interface. 11.2.2 Robust recipes The default scale for continuous fill scales is scale_fill_continuous() which in turn defaults to scale_fill_gradient(). As a consequence, these three commands produce the same plot using a gradient scale. Gradient scales provide a robust method for creating any colour scheme you like. You just specify two or more reference colours, and ggplot2 will interpolate linearly between them. Three functions that you can use for this purpose are *scale_fill_gradient() produces a two-colour gradient *scale_fill_gradient2() produces a three-colour gradient with specified midpoint *scale_fill_gradientn() produces an n-colour gradient The Munsell colour system provides an easy way of specifying colours based on their hue, chroma and luminance. The munsell package provides easy access to the Munsell colours, which can then be used to specify a gradient scale. For more information on the munsell package see https://github.com/cwickham/munsell/. Three-point gradient scales typically convey the perceptual impression that there is a natural midpoint (often a zero value) from which the other values diverge. The left plot below shows how to create a divergent “yellow/blue” scale. If you have colours that are meaningful for your data (e.g., black body colours or standard terrain colours), or you’d like to use a palette produced by another package, you may wish to use an n-point gradient. The middle and right plots below use the colorspace package. For more information on the colorspace package see https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/. 11.2.3 Missing values All continuous colour scales have an na.value parameter that controls what colour is used for missing values (including values outside the range of the scale limits). By default it is set to grey, which will stand out when you use a colourful scale. If you use a black and white scale, you might want to set it to something else to make it more obvious. You can set na.value = NA to make missing values invisible, or choose a specific colour if you prefer: 11.2.4 Limits, breaks and labels You can suppress the breaks entirely by setting them to NULL. For axes, this removes the tick marks, grid lines, and labels; and for legends this removes the keys and labels. 11.2.5 Legends "],["discrete-colour-scales.html", "11.3 Discrete colour scales", " 11.3 Discrete colour scales Discrete colour and fill scales occur in many situations. A typical example is a barchart that encodes both position and fill to the same variable. The default scale for discrete colours is scale_fill_discrete() which in turn defaults to scale_fill_hue() so these are identical plots: 11.3.1 Brewer scales scale_colour_brewer() is a discrete colour scale that—along with the continuous analog scale_colour_distiller() and binned analog scale_colour_fermenter()—uses handpicked “ColorBrewer” colours taken from http://colorbrewer2.org/. These colours have been designed to work well in a wide variety of situations, although the focus is on maps and so the colours tend to work better when displayed in large areas. There are many different options: The first group of palettes are sequential scales that are useful when your discrete scale is ordered (e.g., rank data), and are available for continuous data using scale_colour_distiller(). For unordered categorical data, the palettes of most interest are those in the second group. ‘Set1’ and ‘Dark2’ are particularly good for points, and ‘Set2’, ‘Pastel1’, ‘Pastel2’ and ‘Accent’ work well for areas. Note that no palette is uniformly good for all purposes. Scatter plots typically use small plot markers, and bright colours tend to work better than subtle ones: Bar plots usually contain large patches of colour, and bright colours can be overwhelming. Subtle colours tend to work better in this situation: 11.3.2 Hue and grey scales The default colour scheme picks evenly spaced hues around the HCL colour wheel. This works well for up to about eight colours, but after that it becomes hard to tell the different colours apart. You can control the default chroma and luminance, and the range of hues, with the h, c and l arguments: One disadvantage of the default colour scheme is that because the colours all have the same luminance and chroma, when you print them in black and white, they all appear as an identical shade of grey. Noting this, if you are intending a discrete colour scale to be printed in black and white, it is better to use scale_fill_grey() which maps discrete data to grays, from light to dark: 11.3.3 Paleteer Scales 11.3.4 Manual scales If none of the hand-picked palettes is suitable, or if you have your own preferred colours, you can use scale_fill_manual() to set the colours manually. This can be useful if you wish to choose colours that highlight a secondary grouping structure or draw attention to different comparisons: You can also use a named vector to specify colors to be assigned to each level which allows you to specify the levels in any order you like: 11.3.5 Limits, breaks and labels 11.3.6 Legends "],["binned-colour-scales.html", "11.4 Binned colour scales", " 11.4 Binned colour scales Color scales also come in binned versions. The default scale is scale_fill_binned() which in turn defaults to scale_fill_steps(). These scales have an n.breaks argument that controls the number of discrete colour categories created by the scale. Counterintuitively—because the human visual system is very good at detecting edges—this can sometimes make a continuous colour gradient easier to perceive: In other respects scale_fill_steps() is analogous to scale_fill_gradient(), and allows you to construct your own two-colour gradients. There is also a three-colour variant scale_fill_steps2() and n-colour scale variant scale_fill_stepsn() that behave similarly to their continuous counterparts: A brewer analog for binned scales also exists, and is called scale_fill_fermenter(): Note that like the discrete scale_fill_brewer()—and unlike the continuous scale_fill_distiller()—the binned function scale_fill_fermenter() does not interpolate between the brewer colours, and if you set n.breaks larger than the number of colours in the palette a warning message will appear and some colours will not be displayed. 11.4.1 Limits, breaks and labels 11.4.2 Legends "],["date-time-colour-scales.html", "11.5 Date Time Colour Scales", " 11.5 Date Time Colour Scales When a colour aesthetic is mapped to a date/time type, ggplot2 uses scale_colour_date() or scale_colour_datetime() to specify the scale. These are designed to handle date data, analogous to the date scales discussed in Section 10.2. These scales have date_breaks and date_labels arguments that make it a little easier to work with these data, as the slightly contrived example below illustrates: "],["alpha-scales.html", "11.6 Alpha scales", " 11.6 Alpha scales Alpha scales map the transparency of a shade to a value in the data and can be a convenient way to visually down-weight less important observations. scale_alpha() is an alias for scale_alpha_continuous() since that is the most common use of alpha, and it saves a bit of typing. "],["legend-position.html", "11.7 Legend position", " 11.7 Legend position A number of settings that affect the overall display of the legends are controlled through the theme system. You’ll learn more about that in Section 18.2, but for now, all you need to know is that you modify theme settings with the theme() function. The position and justification of legends are controlled by the theme setting legend.position, which takes values “right”, “left”, “top”, “bottom”, or “none” (no legend). Switching between left/right and top/bottom modifies how the keys in each legend are laid out (horizontal or vertically), and how multiple legends are stacked (horizontal or vertically). If needed, you can adjust those options independently: legend.direction: layout of items in legends (“horizontal” or “vertical”). legend.box: arrangement of multiple legends (“horizontal” or “vertical”). legend.box.just: justification of each legend within the overall bounding box, when there are multiple legends (“top”, “bottom”, “left”, or “right”). Alternatively, if there’s a lot of blank space in your plot you might want to place the legend inside the plot by setting legend.position to a numeric vector of length two. The numbers represent a relative location in the panel area: c(0, 1) is the top-left corner and c(1, 0) is the bottom-right corner. You control which corner of the legend the legend.position refers to with legend.justification, which is specified in a similar way. Unfortunately positioning the legend exactly where you want it requires a lot of trial and error.

The default scale for size aesthetics is scale_size() in which a linear increase in the variable is mapped onto a linear increase in the area (not the radius) of the geom. There are several size scales: scale_size_area() and scale_size_binned_area() are versions of scale_size() and scale_size_binned() that ensure that a value of 0 maps to an area of 0. scale_radius() maps the data value to the radius rather than to the area (Section 12.1.1). scale_size_binned() is a size scale that behaves like scale_size() but maps continuous values onto discrete size categories, analogous to the binned position and colour scales discussed in Sections 10.4 and 11.4 respectively. Legends associated with this scale are discussed in Section 12.1.2. scale_size_date() and scale_size_datetime() are designed to handle date data, analogous to the date scales discussed in Section 10.2. 12.1.1 Radius size scales There are situations where area scaling is undesirable, and for such situations scale_radius() may be more appropriate. For example, consider a data set containing astronomical data that includes the radius of different planets: ## name type position radius orbit ## 1 Mercury Inner 1 2440 57900000 ## 2 Venus Inner 2 6052 108200000 ## 3 Earth Inner 3 6378 149600000 ## 4 Mars Inner 4 3390 227900000 ## 5 Jupiter Outer 5 71400 778300000 ## 6 Saturn Outer 6 60330 1427000000 ## 7 Uranus Outer 7 25559 2871000000 ## 8 Neptune Outer 8 24764 4497100000 12.1.2 Binned size scales Binned size scales work similarly to binned scales for colour and position aesthetics (Sections 11.4 and 10.4) with the exception of how legends are displayed. The default legend for a binned size scale, and all binned scales except position and colour aesthetics, is governed by guide_bins(). For instance, in the mpg data we could use scale_size_binned() to create a binned version of the continuous variable hwy: Unlike guide_legend(), the guide created for a binned scale by guide_bins() does not organize the individual keys into a table. Instead they are arranged in a column (or row) along a single vertical (or horizontal) axis, which by default is displayed with its own axis. The important arguments to guide_bins() are listed below: axis indicates whether the axis should be drawn (default is TRUE) direction is a character string specifying the direction of the guide, either “vertical” (the default) or “horizontal” show.limits specifies whether tick marks are shown at the ends of the guide axis (default is FALSE) axis.colour, axis.linewidth and axis.arrow are used to control the guide axis that is displayed alongside the legend keys keywidth, keyheight, reverse and override.aes have the same behavior for guide_bins() as they do for guide_legend() (see Section 11.3.6) "],["shape.html", "12.2 Shape", " 12.2 Shape Values can be mapped to the shape aesthetic, most typically when you have a small number of discrete categories. Note: if the data variable contains more than 6 values it becomes difficult to distinguish between shapes, and will produce a warning. Although any one plot is unlikely to be readable with more than a 6 distinct markers, there are 25 possible shapes to choose from. The default scale_shape() function contains a single argument: set solid = TRUE (the default) to use a “palette” consisting of three solid shapes and three hollow shapes, or set solid = FALSE to use six hollow shapes: You can specify the marker types for each data value manually using scale_shape_manual(). For more information about manual scales see Section 12.4. "],["line-type.html", "12.3 Line type", " 12.3 Line type It is possible to map a variable onto the linetype aesthetic, which works best for discrete variables with a small number of categories, where scale_linetype() is an alias for scale_linetype_discrete(). Continuous variables cannot be mapped to line types unless scale_linetype_binned() is used: although there is a scale_linetype_continuous() function, all it does is produce an error. With five categories the above plot is quite difficult to read. The default “palette” for linetype is supplied by the scales::linetype_pal() function, and includes the 13 linetypes shown below: You can control the line type by specifying a string with up to 8 hexadecimal values. In this specification, -the first value is the length of the first line segment, the second value is the length of the first space between segments, and so on. This allows you to specify your own line types using scale_linetype_manual(), or alternatively, by passing a custom function to the palette argument. Note that the last four lines are blank, because the linetypes() function defined above returns NA when the number of categories exceeds 9. The scale_linetype() function contains a na.value argument used to specify what kind of line is plotted for these values. By default this produces a blank line, but you can override this by setting na.value = “dotted”: Valid line types can be set using a human readable character string: “blank”, “solid”, “dashed”, “dotted”, “dotdash”, “longdash”, and “twodash” are all understood. "],["manual-scales-1.html", "12.4 Manual scales", " 12.4 Manual scales Manual scales are just a list of valid values that are mapped to the unique discrete values. If you want to customize these scales, you need to create your own new scale with the “manual” version of each: scale_linetype_manual(), scale_shape_manual(), scale_colour_manual(), etc. The manual scale has one important argument, values, where you specify the values that the scale should produce if this vector is named, it will match the values of the output to the values of the input; otherwise it will match in order of the levels of the discrete variable. You will need some knowledge of the valid aesthetic values, which are described in vignette(“ggplot2-specs”). Manual scales have appeared earlier, in Sections 11.3.4 and 12.2. In the following example, you’ll see a creative use of scale_colour_manual() to display multiple variables on the same plot and show a useful legend. -In most plotting systems, you’d color the lines and then add a legend: That doesn’t work in ggplot because there’s no way to add a legend manually.
